# TWC Icons

A place to store icons (e.g. social media icons for e-mail signatures), linkable via free CDN ([jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com)). Current round icon set provided by [Tom](http://tomswebspace.com).

### Usage Example

Example linking to Twitter icon via jsDelivr:

```html
<a href="https://twitter.com/thewandcompany/">
  <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/thewandcompany/icons/round/35px/twitter.png" alt="Twitter" title="Twitter" width="25" height="25" />
</a>
```

Replace the [icon name](https://github.com/thewandcompany/icons/tree/master/icons/round/50px/) and social media link as desired.

Please **DO NOT** link to the file directly on GitHub. Please use a CDN, as shown above.
